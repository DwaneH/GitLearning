# What is Git?

Git is a version control tool used for tracking changes in source code and other files.  
Widely used in software development, Git helps teams manage and coordinate their work efficiently.
Git allows you to work decentralized, meaning all work is done locally, multiple people can work on the same code simultaneously without overriding each other's work.  
Git keeps a complete history of all changes made to the files it is tracking, allowing you to revert to previous versions.

# What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git projects (think Dropbox for devs), enabling developers to collaborate on projects by sharing and managing code online.  
It provides tools for code review (Pull Requests), issue tracking, and continuous integration (GitHub Actions), making it easier for teams to work together.  
GitHub also offers a social aspect, allowing users to follow projects, contribute to open-source software, and showcase their work.  
GitHub is used for both open-source and private projects, serving as a central hub for code collaboration and project management.
