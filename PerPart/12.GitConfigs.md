# Git Configs:

With most of the common Git commands under the belt its time to look into the configs to help make our lives easier.  

Git has 3 levels of configuration:
- **System** - This is for the computer scope and lives in the Git installation folder
- **Global** - This is for the current user scope and lives in your User home folder
- **Local** - This is for the current repo scope and lives in the ,git folder within the repo

Configs can have the same settings with different values, Local will override Global which will override System.  
This override allows you to set repo specific settings such as your `user.name` and `user.email` if your personal username and email differs to your team/business/client.  

### Common Configs:
#### User:
- `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
- `git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"`
#### Editor:
- `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"` - This sets VS Code as the default editor for Git
- `git config --global diff.tool=default-difftool` - Part 1 of setting your diff checking tool
- `git config --global difftool.default-difftool.cmd=code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE` - Part 2 of setting VS Code as your default diff checking tool
- `git config --global merge.tool=code` - Part 1 of setting VS Code as your merge conflict tool
- `git config --global mergetool.code.cmd=code --wait --merge $REMOTE $LOCAL $BASE $MERGED` - Part 2 of setting VS Code as your default merge conflict tool
#### Aliases:
- `git config --global alias.st status` = `git st` = `git status`
- `git config --global alias.cm "commit -m"` = `git cm "Message explaining the file changes"`
- `git config --global alias.lg "log --oneline --graph --all --decorate"`
- `git config --global alias.co checkout`

`--global` can be changed to `--local` if you want to set configs differently per repo.
