# Further Git Info:

### Commands not yet taught: (That I use)
- `git tag <tag name> <commit sha>` - Adds a tag to the commit, this tag can be named to reference a version/release/anything. It gives you an easily selectable point in your history.
- `git mv <file name> <new file name>` - Uses git to move/rename a file or folder
- `git diff` - Shows the file differences between unstaged items and most recent commit
  - `git diff HEAD` - Shows the file differences between uncommitted items and most recent commit
  - `git diff <commit1> <commit2>` - Shows the file differences between commits, you can use shas/branches/tags
  - `git difftool <commit1> <commit2>` - Uses the diff tool specified in your git config
- `git show <commit>` - Shows the files changed in the commit or lastest branch HEAD
- `git clean -<options>` - Cleans the repo based on options used, removes files that are untracked (Caution)
  - `-xdn` - Show everything to remove that is not tracked
  - `-xdf` - Remove everything that is not tracked (Caution, deletes files you may have worked on but not committed and ignored files you want to keep)
- `gitk <item>` - UI variation for `git log`
- `git stash ` - Saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit
  - `git stash save <name>` - To create a meaningful name to the stashed files
  - `git stash list` - To view the stash
  - `git stash pop` - Bring back the most recent stash
  - `git stash branch <branchname>` - To create a new branch and bring back most recent stash
- `git rebase <branch>` - (**DANGER** :warning:) Merges <branch> into your current branch with a rebase, this rewrites all your commits to come after <branch> making your history look clean
- `git reset <option>` - (**DANGER** :warning:) Resets the curent commit or more
- **DANGER** commands will be explained in another lesson. They change commit shas and will cause issues with team members. These commands could also delete work or even commits.
