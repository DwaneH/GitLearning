
## Untracked Files:  

Files in your working directory that are not yet being tracked by Git.  
This means Git is not keeping an eye on changes to these files.  
When you create a new file in your repo directory (or copy something in), Git doesn’t automatically start tracking it but it will show you that it is untracked.  
It’s considered "untracked" until you tell Git to track it by staging and then committing.
