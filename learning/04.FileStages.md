
# Files and Stages:

In Git, when working locally on files they will have different "states" or "stages" to help track it within the version control system.  
Git manages changes to files in a repository based on these stages.  
There are several stages for files in Git:

- **Untracked**: These are new files git is not tracking.  
- **Not Staged**: These are updated files, they need to be staged and cmomitted for git to track changes.  
- **Staged**: These are files ready to be added to the next commit.  
- **Committed/Tracked**: Filies that have been committed are tracked by Git.  

Understanding what state any of the files within your repo are currently in is **very important**!  
You don't want to miss required files or end up adding unnecessary files.  
There is a very useful command you should be using to check your repo and file stages: **`git status`**  
Use **`git status`** often!
