## What is Git Revert?

Git revert is a command used to create a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit. Unlike `git reset`, which removes commits from the project history, `git revert` adds a new commit that reverses the changes while keeping the original commit intact. This makes it a safe way to undo changes, especially in shared repositories, as it doesn't alter the existing commit history.

Key points about Git revert:
- It's used to undo changes from past commits.
- It creates a new commit rather than modifying existing ones.
- It's safe to use on public branches that others may be using.
- It allows you to reverse specific commits without affecting subsequent changes.

## How Git Revert Works

The basic syntax for Git revert is:

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

When you run this command:

1. Git identifies the changes introduced by the specified commit.
2. It automatically creates a new commit that undoes those changes.
3. Your working directory and staging area are updated to reflect this new state.

You can also revert multiple commits:

```bash
git revert <oldest-commit-hash>..<latest-commit-hash>
```

This will revert all commits in the specified range, creating a new commit for each revert operation.

If you want to revert a merge commit, you need to specify which parent you want to revert to:

```bash
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>
```

The `-m 1` flag tells Git to revert to the first parent of the merge commit (usually the branch you merged into).

## Practical Example for Git Revert

Let's walk through a practical example of using Git revert:

1. First, let's look at our commit history:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   abc1234 (HEAD -> main) Add new feature XYZ
   def5678 Update documentation
   ghi9101 Fix critical bug in login system
   jkl1121 Initial commit
   ```

2. We realize that the new feature (commit abc1234) is causing issues and we want to undo it. We can revert this commit:

   ```bash
   git revert abc1234
   ```

3. Git will open your default text editor for you to edit the commit message. You can keep the default message or customise it.

4. After saving and closing the editor, Git creates a new commit that undoes the changes from abc1234.

5. If we look at our commit history again:

   ```bash
   git log --oneline
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   mno1314 (HEAD -> main) Revert "Add new feature XYZ"
   abc1234 Add new feature XYZ
   def5678 Update documentation
   ghi9101 Fix critical bug in login system
   jkl1121 Initial commit
   ```

   Note that a new commit (mno1314) has been created to revert the changes, while the original commit (abc1234) still exists in the history.

6. Your working directory now reflects the state of the project before the "Add new feature XYZ" commit, but all subsequent changes (like documentation updates) are still in place.

## Conclusion

Git revert is a powerful and safe way to undo changes in your repository. Its key advantages include:

1. **Safety**: It doesn't alter existing commit history, making it safe for use in shared repositories.
2. **Specificity**: You can revert specific commits without affecting later changes.
3. **Clarity**: Each revert operation creates a new commit, clearly documenting what was undone and why.
4. **Flexibility**: You can revert single commits, ranges of commits, or even merge commits.

However, there are a few things to keep in mind:

- Reverting a commit doesn't remove it from history. If you've committed sensitive information, reverting won't remove it from the repository's history.
- Reverting can sometimes lead to conflicts, especially if the file has been modified in subsequent commits. In these cases, you'll need to resolve the conflicts manually.
- For very recent commits that haven't been shared, using `git reset` might be simpler.
