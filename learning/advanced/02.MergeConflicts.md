# Understanding Merge Conflicts in Git

## What Is a Merge Conflict?

- **Definition**: A merge conflict in Git occurs when changes from different branches or commits are merged together and the same content (lines) were changed on both branches.

- **In Plain Terms**: Imagine two people are editing the same document at the same time. If they both change the same line in different ways, and then try to combine their changes, there will be confusion about which change should be kept. This is what we call a **merge conflict** in Git.

Git is smart, it can automatically merge changes if they are made on different lines or in different files, but it gets stuck when the same part of a file is edited in conflicting ways.

## How Do Merge Conflicts Happen?

1. **Simultaneous Changes on the Same Line**  
You and your teammate both edit the same line of code on different branches.

2. **Conflicting Deletions and Modifications**  
On one branch, you delete a file or a line of code, while on another branch, someone modifies it.

3. **Conflicting Renames**  
You rename a file on one branch while a colleague renames or edits the same file on another branch.

4. **Competing Pull Requests**  
Multiple developers create pull requests that affect the same parts of the codebase.

5. **Unmerged Changes**  
You try to merge a branch that has unmerged changes from a previous conflict.

## How Does This Affect `main`?

- Merges or Pull Requests still move through to the `main` branch changing the files on `main` to the feature they came from which then causes conflicts with another feature being worked on.
  - Branch A and B are both features. B completes their work and makes a Pull Request back into `main`. An hour later branch A tries to merge the updated `main`, however the same lines in the same files were changed between A nd B and now there is a merge conflict between A and `main`.

## Why Do Merge Conflicts Matter?

- **Interruption in Workflow**: Merge conflicts stop you from merging branches, which delays development and requires manual intervention.
- **Risk of Errors**: If not resolved carefully, merge conflicts can introduce bugs or lose important changes that were meant to be implemented.

## Conclusion

Merge conflicts are an inevitable part of collaborative development, but theyâ€™re not something to fear. Understanding why they happen and how to resolve them is a crucial skill for any developer. Let's get into the practical side of things by intentionally creating a merge conflict and walking through the steps to resolve it in `03.MergeResolution.md`.
