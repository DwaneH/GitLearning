# Demonstrating and Resolving Git Merge Conflicts

## Setup

We'll start by setting up a scenario that will lead to a merge conflict.

#### Prep Task 1: Prepare conflict part 1

1. Create a new branch named `feature/prep-work` from `main`:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b feature/prep-work
   ```

2. Edit the `docs/guide.md` file. Add 2 new lines at the top and 2 new lines at the bottom with random text content:
   ```markdown
   This is a new line at the top.
   Another new line at the top.

   [existing content]

   This is a new line at the bottom.
   Another new line at the bottom.
   ```

3. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git add docs/guide.md
   git commit -m "Add new lines to guide.md in feature/prep-work"
   ```

4. Push the branch to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin feature/prep-work
   ```

#### Prep Task 2: Prepare conflict part 2

1. Create a new branch named `feature/prep-conflict` from `main`:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b feature/prep-conflict
   ```

2. Edit the `docs/guide.md` file. Add 2 different new lines at the top and bottom:
   ```markdown
   This is a different new line at the top.
   Another different new line at the top.

   [existing content]

   This is a different new line at the bottom.
   Another different new line at the bottom.
   ```

3. Commit the changes:
   ```
   git add docs/guide.md
   git commit -m "Add different new lines to guide.md in feature/prep-conflict"
   ```

4. Push the branch to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin feature/prep-conflict
   ```

Both branches have changes to the same line in a file called `docs/guide.md`. This will set us up perfectly to demonstrate how Git handles (or struggles with) these changes.

## Triggering the Conflict

Now that we have two branches with conflicting changes, let's trigger the merge conflict:

1. Checkout the `feature/prep-work` branch:
   ```
   git checkout feature/prep-work
   ```

2. Attempt to merge `feature/prep-conflict` into `feature/prep-work`:
   ```
   git merge feature/prep-conflict
   ```

You should see a message indicating a merge conflict in `docs/guide.md`:
```
Auto-merging docs/guide.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in docs/guide.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

## Checking Before Merging with git difftool

It is always a good idea to check differences before attempting to merge (this will still work in the middle of the conflict):

1. Use `git difftool` to compare the branches:
   ```
   git difftool feature/prep-work feature/prep-conflict
   ```

2. This will open your configured diff tool, showing the differences between the two versions of `docs/guide.md`.

3. Review the differences to understand what changes are in conflict.  

Using git difftool gives you a clear visual representation of changes, making it easier to understand whatâ€™s happening in your code.

## Resolving a Merge Conflict in Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code provides an excellent interface for resolving merge conflicts:

1. Open the project in VS Code.

2. Navigate to the `docs/guide.md` file. You'll see conflict markers:
   ```
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   This is a new line at the top.
   Another new line at the top.
   =======
   This is a different new line at the top.
   Another different new line at the top.
   >>>>>>> feature/prep-conflict
   ```

3. VS Code will highlight these sections and provide options to accept current changes, incoming changes, or both.

4. For each conflict:
   - Click on "Accept Current Change" to keep the changes from `feature/prep-work`.
   - Click on "Accept Incoming Change" to use the changes from `feature/prep-conflict`.
   - Click on "Accept Both Changes" to keep both sets of changes.
   - Or manually edit the file to combine the changes as desired.

5. After resolving all conflicts, save the file. From here it becomes similar to a normal add and commit.

6. Stage the resolved file:
   ```
   git add docs/guide.md
   ```

7. Complete the merge by committing:
   ```
   git commit -m "Merge feature/prep-conflict into feature/prep-work, resolving conflicts"
   ```
  
8. Another option is to choose `Resolve in Merge Editor`, this will split your window into 3 parts. Note that the left part is now the incoming and right is your current branch. This still functions the same as above with the additional parts at the top showing the diffs.

## Conclusion

In this guide, we've walked through the process of:
1. Setting up a scenario that leads to a merge conflict
2. Triggering the conflict
3. Using `git difftool` to examine differences before merging
4. Resolving the conflict using Visual Studio Code

Remember, while merge conflicts can be intimidating, they're a normal part of collaborative development. With practice, you'll become more comfortable handling them efficiently.

Always communicate with your team when resolving conflicts, especially for complex merges. It's often helpful to discuss the desired outcome before making significant changes.
