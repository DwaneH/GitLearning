# CLI movement and usage:

### Navigation and Selection: (Similar to any text based navigation - Notepad/VSCode/Word)
- Ctrl + Left/Right - Jump 1 word left or right
- Shift + Left/Right - Highlight 1 letter left/right
- Shift + Home/End - Highlight to beginning/end of line
- Ctrl + Shift + Left/Right - Highlight 1 word left or right
- Ctrl + / - VS Code shortcut to comment out line or highlighted code
- Ctrl + [ and Ctrl + ] - VS Code indentation shifting left `[` or right `]`

### CLI Commands:
- Up/Down - Up to get to previous commands used, down to scroll back through
- Esc / Ctrl + Home - Clean current CLI text (Ctrl cleans from cursor to home)
- Tab - Tries to complete current available word or local file name
- Ctrl + Space - Display available commands depending on current input (may be terminal dependent)
- Ctrl + L - Clean terminal window
- **`git <command> -h` - Print out help to the CLI, this is `-h` or `--help` for most CLI programs**
- Ctrl + C - Global **hard cancel** out of most situations

### Directory Commands: (Directory = Folder)
- . - This is used as the current folder, tab completing will generally add .\ or ./ to the file or folder name
- .. - This is used as the parent folder relative to your current folder
- `cd ..` - Move to the parent folder
- `cd ..\..\..` - Will move up 3 folders
- `cd <DirectoryName>` - Change directory to the child directory that is in your current folder
- `cd c:\` - Change directory to C:\ drive
- `mkdir <DirectoryName>` - Makes a new folder in your current folder

### Recommendations for Directory Structure:
- Select a drive to store your development/coding work: `C:\` `D:\` `E:\` ...etc
- Use a basic folder and keep short names: `C:\Dev\`
- Separate folders for personal, business, client related: `C:\Dev\Personal\` `C:\Dev\VC\` `C:\Dev\Kaleidocode\`
- Remember to be specific with your capitilization, Git in Windows is slightly forgiving but there can be issues with some features
