# GitHub Settings:

GitHub gives you control over your repo to customize and manage several features.

## User Settings
User settings allow you to manage your personal profile and customize your GitHub experience.  
In this section, you can update your display name, add a bio, and link your social media profiles.
These details help others in the GitHub community connect with you.  

## Repository Settings
Repository settings give you control over individual repositories.  
Here, you can manage access permissions, deciding who can view or contribute to your code.  
You can also set branch protections, which help maintain code quality by enforcing rules on commits and pull requests.  
Other options include enabling webhooks for automation, setting up security policies, and determining whether your repository is public, private, or part of an organization.  

## Security Settings
Security settings on GitHub are crucial for keeping your code and account safe.  
In your User Profile section, you can enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for added account security.  
You can also manage your SSH and GPG keys to securely sign your commits and establish secure connections to GitHub.  
In the Repository settings, GitHub allows you to configure security features like dependency scanning, which automatically checks for vulnerabilities in your codeâ€™s dependencies.  

## Notifications Settings
Notifications settings help you stay informed about activities related to your repositories and the accounts you follow. You can customize how and when you receive notifications.
